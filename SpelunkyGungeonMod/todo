Moves extremely fast (1-3 spaces per beat (but only 1 when close to player), diagonal, moves more spaces, moves through walls), instant kills, has "scythe" attack that swings in an arc.
However, normally stays in a single spot. Killing an enemy next to it "enrages" it, causing the attacks.
To kill it without worrying about enraging it, you can either use 3 bombs in a row, spell spam, or very high damage, or tanky build (with shields and freezes or quartz armor high hp) (edited)
